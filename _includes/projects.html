    <h3>Backstop</h3>
    <p>
      Backstop connects parents of children with Anaphylaxis with other
      caretakers in the child's life. Parents invite their children's
      daycare providers, soccer coaches, and school nurses to view
      information about their child's anaphylaxis devices and learn
      how to react to episodes through educational video series.

    <h3>Torq Interface</h3>
    <p>
      Torq is an app for medical device representatives. Joint replacement
      surgeries require a human from the company which created the joint
      replacement to be in the operating room with the surgeon. As surgeons'
      schedules change throughout the day, reps are paid to wait around or hurry
      to the hospital. Torq sends reps live schedule updates using push
      notifications by hooking into hospitals' electronic health records. I
      scaled Torq from zero lines of code to its use in over 20 hospitals around
      Boston.
